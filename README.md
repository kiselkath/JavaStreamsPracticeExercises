# 💡 Java Streams Practice Exercises — FlatMap, Collectors, Custom Collectors

Welcome to **Practice Day**! These exercises are designed to reinforce your understanding of:

* `flatMap()`
* Built-in `Collectors`
* Custom `Collector`

Each exercise is small and focused, perfect for coding in a REPL or as standalone Java classes. No external libraries needed.

---

## 🔄 Exercise 1: Flatten Sentences into Words

### **Task:**

Given a `List<String>` where each element is a sentence, use `flatMap()` to extract all words into a flat `List<String>`.

### **Input:**

```java
List<String> sentences = List.of("Java is fun", "Streams are powerful");
```

### **Output:**

```java
["Java", "is", "fun", "Streams", "are", "powerful"]
```

### ✅ Concepts:

* `flatMap`
* `Stream.of().split(" ")`

---

## 📦 Exercise 2: Group Products by Category

### **Task:**

Given a `List<Product>` with fields `name`, `category`, and `price`, group them by `category`.

### ✅ Concepts:

* `Collectors.groupingBy()`
* `Collectors.mapping()` (Optional Bonus)

---

## 📊 Exercise 3: Count Items by Status

### **Task:**

Given a `List<Task>` with fields `title` and `status`, return a map counting tasks per status.

### ✅ Concepts:

* `groupingBy` + `counting()`

---

## 🧮 Exercise 4: Average Rating by Genre

### **Task:**

Given a `List<Movie>` with fields `title`, `genre`, `rating`, compute average rating per genre.

### ✅ Concepts:

* `groupingBy` + `averagingDouble()`

---

## 🔀 Exercise 5: Custom Collector - Sentence Stats

### **Task:**

Create a custom collector to process a `Stream<String>` of sentences and return a custom object `SentenceStats` that stores:

* total sentence count
* total word count
* average words per sentence

### 💡 Hints:

* Use a class `SentenceStats` with `int sentenceCount`, `int wordCount`.
* `accumulator()` should split each sentence by space and update counters.
* `getAverage()` = wordCount / sentenceCount.

### ✅ Concepts:

* Custom `Collector`
* `accumulator()`, `combiner()`, `finisher()`

---

## 🛠️ Exercise 6: Flatten Author → Books → Pages

### **Task:**

You have a list of `Author`, each with `List<Book>`, each `Book` has `List<String>` pages.
Use **three levels of flatMap** to get a `List<String>` of all pages from all books by all authors.

### 💡 Hints:

* Start with `authors.stream()`
* Use `.flatMap(author -> author.getBooks().stream())`
* Then `.flatMap(book -> book.getPages().stream())`

### ✅ Concepts:

* Nested `flatMap()`

---

## 📅 Exercise 7: Group Events by Day of Week

### **Task:**

Given a `List<Event>` with a `LocalDate` field, group all events by `DayOfWeek`.

### 💡 Hints:

* Use `event.getDate().getDayOfWeek()`
* Requires importing `java.time.DayOfWeek`

### ✅ Concepts:

* `groupingBy(event -> event.getDate().getDayOfWeek())`

---

## 🛒 Exercise 8: Build Shopping Summary Collector

### **Task:**

Write a custom collector that accepts `Item` objects and outputs a `ShoppingSummary` with:

* total number of items
* total price
* average price

### 💡 Hints:

* Use a mutable object to accumulate totals.
* `supplier()` returns a new `ShoppingSummary`.
* Final result can be just `ShoppingSummary` (no map needed).

### ✅ Concepts:

* Custom `Collector`
* Real-world use of accumulation logic

---

## 📈 Bonus: Department Employee Project Stats

### **Task:**

Given a `List<Employee>` with `List<Project>` each with `status` and `budget`, build:

* Count of active projects per department
* Average budget of completed projects per department

### 💡 Hints:

* Use `.flatMap()` to access all projects
* Add `.filter(p -> p.getStatus().equals("active"))`
* Combine `groupingBy()` with `counting()` or `averagingDouble()`

### ✅ Concepts:

* Combining `flatMap`, `filter`, `groupingBy`, `averagingDouble`, `counting`
